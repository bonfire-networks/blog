            We endeavour to develop tools for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviviality" target="_blank" class="link">conviviality</a>. Tools that you total control over, which are not developed for extracting value from their users in any way. 
            Each Bonfire instance is shaped by its members to pursue their community goals, not those of some investment fund.

            Add or remove extensions based on the functionality you need, or go futher and create a new extension. Pick or create a theme that reflects your community identity, edit and localise text to increase inclusivity, decide which kind of information and behaviours to include and fight the dopamine economy.
